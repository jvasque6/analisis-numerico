# Numerical Analysis Project

This github is about our numerical analysis project which is about implement several numerical methods that will be studied during the course of the subject in a web application.The github's objective is record our implementations, progress and results of our project. Also, we want to share the knowledge acquired in the Numerical Analysis subject with our homeworks in the subjects and the results of our project.

## Requirements

Our programs is mainly coded in Python 3.7.0 and some of them with C++ with G++ 5.4.0 , the libraries needed will be specified in the code or in the README's. 

## Usage

For python implementations(Linux):

```
python3 <code>.py
```

For C++ implmentations(Linux):

```
g++ <code>.cpp -o <executable>
./<executable>
```
